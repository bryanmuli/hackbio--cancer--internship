**DRUG DISCOVERY: THE IC50 BASIC INTRODUCTION**

Author (@slack) : Bryan Muli (@brayo)

IC50, also referred to as the half- maximal inhibitory concentration, is of key significance during the drug discovery process. IC50 is a measure of the concentration of a drug to inhibit a cellular process or biological target by half( 50%). Biological targets include microbes, enzymes, cell receptors or cells. In cancer studies, it is referred to as the potency of a chemotherapeutic drug to kill 50% of cancer cells. The IC50 is essential for understanding the biological and pharmacological properties of a chemotherapeutic drug.

**METHODS**

IC50 is quantified _in-vitro,_ biological samples outside their normal biological context. The EC50 is comparable to the IC50 in that it is obtained _in- vivo_, biological samples in their normal biological context. Most approaches to determine IC50 of a chemotherapeutic drug are based on assays that utilise whole cell systems. These approaches provide outstanding potency information, however results depend on the experimental cell line used and may not differentiate a compound’s ability to inhibit specific interactions. The assays involved in determining IC50 include competitive binding and functional antagonist assays. The IC50 is expressed as micromolar (µM), nanomolar (nM) or millimolar (mM). These units depend on the potency of the compound where the lower values indicate higher potency. The IC50 is determined by exposing the cancer cells to differential drug concentrations in a 96- microwell plate. The well values should be converted to percentage inhibition or percentage activity in relation to the negative or positive control used. A dose- response curve is then constructed and the IC50  value calculated as the concentration that is needed to inhibit half of the maximum biological response of the antagonist. The curve constructed is a sigmoid and is constructed using non-linear regression and fitted to the Hill’s equation. The following is an example of concentration-response best fit by the Hill slope model.Both asymptotes are defined by the data, and the fitting error is approximately the same with all 3 models. Note that even though the fitting error is smallest with the top fixed (8.63% versus 9.51%), the reduction is not small enough to warrant the fixed top model, nor is there any material change in the IC50. The fixed bottom model is clearly inappropriate as the data clearly defines a bottom >0.

The hill equation is represented as the following

Y= bottom+(top- bottom1+(IC50X)n)

- **Y** is the response (e.g., percent inhibition).

- **Bottom** and **Top** are the minimum and maximum response values.

- **Hill Slope** describes the steepness of the curve.

- **X** is the drug concentration

There are softwares developed like GraphPad prism that also calculate the IC50 accurately.

**CONCLUSION**

The IC50 is an essential unit that is used to measure a drug’s potency and selectivity thus aiding in the drug discovery process. It is useful in eliminating drugs that lack sufficient potency with only the most effective advancing to the other drug discovery process. This helps to create safer drugs that are effective at combating cancer.
